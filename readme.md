## What is the example projects about?

I just wanted to try out some things , many of these projects won't be up to production standards but I just want
a place i could check in my work and have a very ROUGH reference on how certain things work.

#### Below is the list of things have touched so far in this folder of example projects

- Basic JWT token
- Example of USSD like service
- Encrypting text by converting it to Bas64 then using caesar cipher (not secure but better than plane text)
- Very basic QR generator and reader
- Very basic URL shortner
- Spring boot - mongodb crud example (very basic)
- Spring boot jpa critera
- Spring webflow
- Service discover example
- MediaPlayer
- Discord bot
- Web scraper
- Cucumber (BDD)
- Basic Q and A application ( if you want to save information)

## Why do I do this?
I am very curious person and like experementing on new things. I believe one should not hastely jump to the latest and greatest without understanding the techonology or approach first. This is just place for me to have some fun and maybe in the future if I want to deleve deeper I can do that :)
